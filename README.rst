Muninn Sentinel-2 extension
===========================

This module provides a namespace extension and a product type extension for
Sentinel-2 products for use in Muninn archives.

You can use this module as-is, but you can also use it as a template.
Depending on your use case you might want to adapt the module and use a
different product type naming convention (e.g. with mission prefix),
have the ``analyze()`` function return properties for additional
namespaces that you may have, have products stored in zipped format, etc.
